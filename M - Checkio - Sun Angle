# M - Checkio - Sun Angle
# Every true traveler must know how to do 3 things: fix the fire,
# find the water and extract useful information from the nature around him.
# Programming won't help you with the fire and water,
# but when it comes to the information extraction - it might be just the thing you need.
# Your task is to find the angle of the sun above the horizon knowing the time of the day.
# Input data: the sun rises in the East at 6:00 AM, which corresponds to the angle of 0 degrees.
# At 12:00 PM the sun reaches its zenith, which means that the angle equals 90 degrees. 6:00 PM
# is the time of the sunset so the angle is 180 degrees.
# If the input will be the time of the night (before 6:00 AM or after 6:00 PM),
# your function should return - "I don't see the sun!".
# example
# Input: The time of the day.
# Output: The angle of the sun, rounded to 2 decimal places.
# Precondition:
# 00:00 <= time <= 23:59
