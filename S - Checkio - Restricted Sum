# S - Checkio - Restricted Sum
# Our new calculator is censored and as such it does not accept certain words.
# You should try to trick by writing a program to calculate the sum of numbers.
# Given a list of numbers, you should find the sum of these numbers. Your solution should not contain any of the banned
# words, even as a part of another word.  \
# The list of banned words are as follows:
# sum
# import
# for
# while
# reduce
#
# Input: A list of numbers.
# Output: The sum of numbers.
# Example:
# 1) checkio([1, 2, 3]) == 6
# 2) checkio([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]) == 12
#
# How it is used: This task challenges your creativity to come up with a solution to fit this mission's specs!
# Precondition: The small amount of data.Let's creativity win!
