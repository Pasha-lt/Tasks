# Stephan has a friend who happens to be a little mechbird. Recently, he was trying to teach it how to speak basic
# language. Today the bird spoke its first word: "hieeelalaooo". This sounds a lot like "hello", but with too many vowels.
# Stephan asked Nikola for help and he helped to examine how the bird changes words. With the information they discovered,
# we should help them to make a translation module. The bird converts words by two rules: - after each consonant letter
# the bird appends a random vowel letter(l ⇒ la or le);
# - after each vowel letter the bird appends two of the same letter(a ⇒ aaa);
# Vowels letters == "aeiouy".
# You are given an ornithological phrase as several words which are separated by white - spaces(each pair of words by one
# whitespace). The bird does not know how to punctuate its phrases and only speaks words as letters. All words are
# given in lowercase. You should translate this phrase from the bird language to something more understandable.
# Input: A bird phrase as a string.
# Output: The translation as a string.
# Example:
# 1) translate("hieeelalaooo") == "hello"
# 2) translate("hoooowe yyyooouuu duoooiiine") == "how you doin"
# 3) translate("aaa bo cy da eee fe") == "a b c d e f"
# 4) translate("sooooso aaaaaaaaa") == "sos aaa"
# How it is used: This a similar cipher to those used by children when they invent their own "bird" language. Now you will
# be ready to crack the code.
# Precondition: re.match("\A([a-z]+\ ?)+(?<!\ )\Z", phrase)
# A phrase always has the translation.
