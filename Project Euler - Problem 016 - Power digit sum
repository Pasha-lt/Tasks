# Project Euler - Problem 16 - Power digit sum
# 2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.
# What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^1000?

# first solution
def foo():
    k = 0
    for i in str(2**1000):
        k += int(i)

    print(k) # 1366


# one line solution
print(sum([int(i) for i in str(2**1000)]))
